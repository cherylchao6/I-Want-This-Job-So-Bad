Using the provided resume JSON file, generate a well-structured HTML page that visually represents the resume information in a clear, professional, and aesthetically pleasing manner. Follow these steps to ensure the HTML page is comprehensive and engaging:

1. Extract all relevant data from the resume JSON file, including personal details, education, work experience, skills, and any additional sections such as certifications or achievements.

2. Organize the extracted information into distinct sections on the HTML page. Each section should be clearly labeled and well-structured to highlight the most important details effectively.

3. Design the HTML page to be visually appealing:
   - Use a clean and modern layout with ample white space to enhance readability.
   - Incorporate CSS for styling purposes. Use fonts that are professional and easy to read, and ensure the color scheme is consistent and suitable for a professional resume.
   - Make use of bullet points or numbered lists to present lists of skills or job responsibilities in a tidy format.

4. Include an introduction section at the top of the HTML page that briefly summarizes the candidate's professional profile or career objective.

5. Ensure the HTML is responsive, making the resume easily viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. Add interactive elements if appropriate, such as links to professional social media profiles, personal websites, or a downloadable PDF version of the resume.

7. Validate the HTML code to ensure it is error-free and adheres to the latest web standards.

Make sure to include all information in the resume JSON file since I want the response directly render in the browser.
